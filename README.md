# POV Project 
POV project with AVR atmega32

# Note
This project doesn't complete yet I will finish it as soon as possible.

# Introduction
POV clock is the project's name, the theory of my project is [Persistance Of Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision) and due to very speed rotation, we can show any shape after full speed. 

There is [an example on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6JnAxTXApw). And I hope to build a better one.

# My Progress
1. DIO driver
2. EXTI driver
3. TMR driver to control the timer
4. POV driver to control the LEDs and show a flexible shape
5. Build an PCB to be more efficient

6. TODO file likes as a log file for working easily
